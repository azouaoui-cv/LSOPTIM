# LSOPTIM
Foundations of Distributed and Large Scale Computing Optimization - Homeworks

## Requirements

This repository is developed on Linux 64-bit in Python 3.7 using [(Mini)conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

To instanciate the conda environment, run ``conda create --file conda-env.txt --name optim``.

Then use pip to install the required Python packages: ``pip -r requirements.txt``.

To use the virtual environment: ``source activate optim``

To install a custom kernel in jupyter lab/notebook: ``ipython kernel install --user --name=optim``

To work on Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab you will need to install it via pip. Follow the instructions [here](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/) to make the environment kernel available in your jupyter installation.
